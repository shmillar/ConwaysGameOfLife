Hello Prof. Ben Amor and Simon!

This is my extra credit project for CSE 355. 

I recreated Conway's Game of Life, which is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. There is a grid of states that are alive, or dead. The game kills or revives states based on the rules of the game.

There are four rules for the Game of Life:
1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

It also follows the three requirements for a cellular automaton:
1. homogeneity: all cell states are updated by the same set of rules;
2. parallelism: all cell states are updated simultaneously;
3. locality: the rules are local in nature.

Hope you guys have a good rest of your semester and summer!

Thanks,

Sam Millar
